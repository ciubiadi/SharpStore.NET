*) CONCEPTS
- Middleware : Middleware is a series of components that are executed in the request-response pipeline. Each middleware component performs a specific function, such as authentication, logging, routing, etc. These components are arranged in a pipeline and process the HTTP request as it flows through the pipeline, allowing developers to add, remove, or reorder components based on their application's requirements.
Middleware in ASP.NET Core provides a flexible and modular way to structure the processing of HTTP requests and responses in web applications.

- Pipeline : A pipeline refers to a series of processing stages through which data or tasks are passed. Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific function, and the output of one stage becomes the input for the next stage. 
- Model : shape of the data ( tables, classes )
- View : the user interface
- Controller : handle the user request and it will act as an user interfcace between Model and View
